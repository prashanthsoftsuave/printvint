== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why do I keep getting a disconnect notification? =
When this plugin cannot communicate with Eloqua, there could be a couple of reasons. Most of the time it's due to a timeout when trying to reach Eloqua's servers. Occasionally, the issue is that the credentials stored to connect to Eloqua have become invalid. If this is the case, simply clear your authentication credentials stored on the Eloqua Settings page in Gravity Forms, and re-authenticate your account. If you're still having issues, enable the Disconnect Notification Debugging setting in order to get more information about why the disconnect occurred. Feel free to send this information along to the plugin developer in order to look into a possible fix to the issue.
